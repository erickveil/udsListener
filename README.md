# udsListener

A Unix Domain Socket Listener test.

The class has everything you need to set up a local socket listener.
The main file just runs the listener as an echo socket.

Use together with the [udsClient](https://github.com/erickveil/udsClient) to run the test.

This program as-is simply echos back what's sent on the local socket.
But the listener class can be used in other applications for IPC.
